Version 2.03 - 2019-10-22

- Improvements:
  - Added a new tracker data chunk to encode a timestamp per tracker.
  - Added flags to trackers to know which chunk have been received
    and to avoid transmitted properties that have not been set.
  - Rewrote the whole implementation to simplify its usage and to
    lower its computational time by reduce memory allocation and copy.
    Warning: The interface changed. You might need to adapt calls to
             the library if you update from a previous version. However,
             the changes should be straightforward.

Version 2.02 - 2018-01-03
===============================================

- Bug: 
  - Description: psn_tracker class constructor always was setting its member 'validity' to 0, ignoring the given parameter
  - Fix: The constructor now uses the given parameter to initialize the member 'validity'.
- Bug:
  - Description: The frame_id needed to be sequential. If not, a frame could be lost when reconstructing frame packets.
  - Fix: Frame IDs can now follow any sequence, as long as two consecutive frames have different IDs.
