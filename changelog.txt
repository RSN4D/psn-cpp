 PosiStageNet Protocol v2.0, November 4th 2014

	 Copyright (c) 2014 VYV Corporation
===============================================

This package contains the documentation and a c++ implementation of the PosiStageNet protocol.
It also contains three simple demo of how to use the implementation from the server or the client side.

The implementation only uses ".hpp" files. If you want to use this implementation in your project, 
you need to include the file "psn_lib.hpp" in one of your ".cpp" file.  

The implementation is cross-platform so it should compile under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
In revenge, the example projects will only work under a Windows operating system as they use a Windows specific implementation
of a simple udp_socket class. If you want to run these demo on another platform, you will need to write your own udp_socket class.

For any question about the PosiStageNet protocol, please write at psn@vyv.ca

Change Log
===============================================

Version 2.02 - 2018-01-03
===============================================

- Bug: 
  - Description: psn_tracker class constructor always was setting its member 'validity' to 0, ignoring the given parameter
  - Fix: The constructor now uses the given parameter to initialize the member 'validity'.
- Bug:
  - Description: The frame_id needed to be sequential. If not, a frame could be lost when reconstructing frame packets.
  - Fix: Frame IDs can now follow any sequence, as long as two consecutive frames have different IDs.
