Version 2.02 - 2018-01-03
===============================================

- Bug: 
  - Description: psn_tracker class constructor was always setting its member 'validity' to 0, ignoring the given parameter
  - Fix: The constructor now uses the given parameter to initialize the member 'validity'.
- Bug:
  - Description: The frame_id needed to be sequential. If not, a frame could be lost when reconstructing frame packets.
  - Fix: Frame IDs can now follow any sequence, as long as two consecutive frames have different IDs.
